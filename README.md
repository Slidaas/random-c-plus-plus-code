# random-c-plus-plus-code
This is just a little bit of c++ code that I am working on, I will be turning this is into a large porject that will take some time. look at all of the files in this repository to find out what I am really doing. Some of the code in this repository may not work, but don't panic! I will be fixing it as soon as I can. I am actually learning how to code better as I am working on this repository. If you want to, you can add or edit the code in here. 

NOTE: All of the code in here is supposed to be c++ only. If I find any other language in here, it will be removed, no matter how hard you worked on it.
